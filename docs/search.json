    "text": "Data\n\nDescription\nThe dataset consists of 50,083 observations and 51 variables, representing prior donors who were part of a large-scale direct mail fundraising experiment. Each row corresponds to an individual who received a solicitation letter, and the variables capture both treatment assignments and individual characteristics.\nThe bar plots show the distribution of key categorical variables in the dataset. The sample is unbalanced across treatment groups by design, with approximately two-thirds assigned to treatment. Only 2.1% of individuals donated, indicating a low response rate. Most of the sample resides in blue states (59.5%), and the majority of donors are male (70.6%) and not donating as a couple (88.7%).\nThe histograms of numeric variables show that both donation-related and historical giving behaviors are highly skewed to the right. Most donation amounts are under $100, and both highest past donation and frequency of past donations exhibit long right tails, suggesting that a small subset of donors account for a disproportionately large share of past giving. The recency variable (mrm2) also shows many donors who haven’t contributed recently, with the most frequent values clustered between 0 and 12 months.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# categorical\ncategorical_vars = ['treatment', 'gave', 'red0', 'female', 'couple']\nlabel_map = {\n    'treatment': {0: 'Control', 1: 'Treatment'},\n    'gave': {0: 'Did Not Give', 1: 'Gave'},\n    'red0': {0: 'Blue State', 1: 'Red State'},\n    'female': {0: 'Male', 1: 'Female'},\n    'couple': {0: 'Single', 1: 'Couple'}\n}\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(16, 8))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, var in enumerate(categorical_vars):\n    ax = axes[i]\n    counts = df[var].value_counts().sort_index()\n    labels = list(label_map[var].values())\n    bars = ax.bar(labels, counts.values, color=sns.color_palette(\"pastel\"))\n\n    for bar, count in zip(bars, counts.values):\n        pct = count / df.shape[0]\n        ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, bar.get_height(), f'{pct:.1%}',\n                ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=9)\n\n    ax.set_title(f\"{var.capitalize()} Distribution\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\n\nif len(categorical_vars) &lt;

Both t-tests (using the class formula) and simple regressions yield non-significant results at the 95% confidence level, with very small t-statistics and large p-values across all variables.\nThese findings align with Table 1 in Karlan and List (2007), providing strong evidence that the random assignment was successfully implemented and that treatment and control groups are balanced in observable covariates. This supports the internal validity of any subsequent causal analysis."

Specifically, receiving a matching grant offer increases the probability of donating by about 0.42 percentage points—rising from roughly 1.79% in the control group to 2.21% in the treatment group. While this absolute change may appear small, it represents a relative increase of over 20%, which is substantial given the typically low baseline response rate in charitable giving.\nTo further support this finding, I estimate a probit model where the outcome is whether a donation was made and the explanatory variable is treatment assignment. The coefficient on treatment is 0.087, which is also statistically significant at the 1% level. Although the coefficient cannot be interpreted directly as a probability, it indicates an increase in the latent propensity to donate among individuals who received the matching message.\nTaken together, the results provide consistent evidence that even modest psychological framing—such as mentioning that a donation will be matched—can meaningfully increase donor response.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nfrom statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import Probit\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nX = sm.add_constant(df['treatment'])\nprobit_model = Probit(df['gave'], X).fit()\n\nprint(probit_model.summary())\n\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n                          Probit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

The differences in mean donation rates across these groups are all very small and none are statistically significant at the 5% level. All p-values are well above 0.30. This suggests that the presence of a match itself may be sufficient to motivate behavior, while increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 offers little incremental benefit.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import t as t_dist\n\ntreatment_df = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1]\n\nratios = {\n    1: treatment_df[treatment_df[\"ratio\"] == 1][\"gave\"],\n    2: treatment_df[treatment_df[\"ratio\"] == 2][\"gave\"],\n    3: treatment_df[treatment_df[\"ratio\"] == 3][\"gave\"]\n}\n\n# t-test\ndef manual_ttest(group1, group2):\n    mean_diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()\n    se = np.sqrt(group1.var(ddof=1)/len(group1) + group2.var(ddof=1)/len(group2))\n    t_stat = mean_diff / se\n    df_denom = (group1.var(ddof=1)/len(group1) + group2.var(ddof=1)/len(group2))**2 / (\n        (group1.var(ddof=1)**2 / ((len(group1)**2)*(len(group1)-1))) + \n        (group2.var(ddof=1)**2 / ((len(group2)**2)*(len(group2)-1)))\n    )\n    p_val = 2 * (1 - t_dist.cdf(abs(t_stat), df=df_denom))\n    return round(mean_diff, 4), round(t_stat, 3), round(p_val, 4)\n\nresults = []\nfor high, low in [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]:\n    diff, t_stat, p_val = manual_ttest(ratios[high], ratios[low])\n    results.append({\n        \"Comparison\": f\"{high}:1 vs {low}:1\",\n        \"Mean Diff\": diff,\n        \"T-stat\": t_stat,\n        \"P-value\": p_val\n    })\n\npd.DataFrame(results)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison\nMean Diff\nT-stat\nP-value\n\n\n\n\n0\n2:1 vs 1:1\n0.0019\n0.965\n0.3345\n\n\n1\n3:1 vs 1:1\n0.0020\n1.015\n0.3101\n\n\n2\n3:1 vs 2:1\n0.0001\n0.050\n0.9600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether higher match ratios influence the likelihood of donating, I regress the binary outcome gave on the categorical variable ratio, using only the treatment group. The 1:1 match ratio serves as the reference category, and the model estimates how donation rates differ under 2:1 and 3:1 matching offers.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\ntreat_df = df[df[\"ratio\"].isin([1, 2, 3])].copy()\n\ntreat_df[\"ratio\"] = treat_df[\"ratio\"].astype(\"category\")\n\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nmodel = smf.ols(\"gave ~ C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))\", data=treat_df).fit()\n\nparams = model.params\npvals = model.pvalues\n\nprint(\"Linear regression comparing match ratios (baseline: 1:1):\")\nprint(f\"  • Intercept (1:1 match): {params['Intercept']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  • 2:1 vs 1:1 match: Coef = {params['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.2]']:.4f}, p = {pvals['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.2]']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  • 3:1 vs 1:1 match: Coef = {params['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.3]']:.4f}, p = {pvals['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.3]']:.4f}\")\n\n\nLinear regression comparing match ratios (baseline: 1:1):\n  • Intercept (1:1 match): 0.0207\n  • 2:1 vs 1:1 match: Coef = 0.0019, p = 0.3383\n  • 3:1 vs 1:1 match: Coef = 0.0020, p = 0.3133\n\n\nThe estimated coefficients for ratio2 and ratio3 are positive, suggesting slightly higher donation rates compared to the 1:1 baseline. However, both coefficients are not statistically significant (p-values &gt; 0.3), indicating that the observed differences could be due to random variation rather than a true treatment effect.\nTo assess whether increasing the match ratio leads to higher response, I compared donation rates directly from the data and from the regression coefficients.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nrate_1 = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio\"] == 1)][\"gave\"].mean()\nrate_2 = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio\"] == 2)][\"gave\"].mean()\nrate_3 = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio\"] == 3)][\"gave\"].mean()\n\ndiff_2_vs_1_data = rate_2 - rate_1\ndiff_3_vs_2_data = rate_3 - rate_2\n\ncoef_2 = model.params['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.2]']\ncoef_3 = model.params['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.3]']\ndiff_3_vs_2_coef = coef_3 - coef_2\n\nprint(\"Donation rate differences (direct from data):\")\nprint(f\"  • 2:1 vs 1:1: {round(diff_2_vs_1_data, 4)}\")\nprint(f\"  • 3:1 vs 2:1: {round(diff_3_vs_2_data, 4)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nEstimated difference from regression coefficients:\")\nprint(f\"  • 2:1 vs 1:1: {round(coef_2, 4)}\")\nprint(f\"  • 3:1 vs 2:1: {round(diff_3_vs_2_coef, 4)}\")\n\n\nDonation rate differences (direct from data):\n  • 2:1 vs 1:1: 0.0019\n  • 3:1 vs 2:1: 0.0001\n\nEstimated difference from regression coefficients:\n  • 2:1 vs 1:1: 0.0019\n  • 3:1 vs 2:1: 0.0001\n\n\nMoving from a 1:1 to a 2:1 match produced a small increase of 0.19%, while the difference between 3:1 and 2:1 was nearly zero (0.01%). These results were mirrored exactly in the regression estimates.\nIn practical terms, offering a match matters, but increasing the match size does not appear to further improve donation response. For fundraisers, this suggests that a basic 1:1 match may be just as effective as higher ratios, but at a lower cost.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\nI regress donation amount on the match ratio using the treatment group, with 1:1 as the reference group. The baseline average donation under 1:1 is $0.94. Compared to this:\n\nThe 2:1 group gives $0.09 more (p = 0.46)\nThe 3:1 group gives almost the same (p = 0.99)\n\nThis suggests that higher match ratios do not meaningfully affect how much people donate, even if they influence whether they donate at all.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\namount_df = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio\"].isin([1, 2, 3]))].copy()\n\n\namount_df[\"ratio\"] = amount_df[\"ratio\"].astype(\"category\")\namount_df[\"ratio\"] = amount_df[\"ratio\"].cat.remove_unused_categories()\n\nmodel_amount = smf.ols(\"amount ~ C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))\", data=amount_df).fit()\n\nmodel_amount.summary()\n\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

Initially, the cumulative average fluctuates substantially, reflecting noise in small samples. As the number of simulated pairs increases, the cumulative average steadily converges toward the true mean difference (indicated by the red dashed line).\nThis pattern illustrates the Law of Large Numbers: with enough data, the average of simulated differences approximates the population-level treatment effect. In this case, the cumulative average stabilizes around the true mean difference, providing visual confirmation that our estimate becomes more reliable as sample size increases.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\ncontrol_data = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 0) & (df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0)][\"amount\"]\ntreat_data = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0)][\"amount\"]\n\n# simulation\ncontrol_draws = np.random.choice(control_data, size=100000, replace=True)\ntreat_draws = np.random.choice(treat_data, size=10000, replace=True)\n\ndiffs = treat_draws - control_draws[:10000]\ncum_avg_diff = np.cumsum(diffs) / np.arange(1, len(diffs) + 1)\ntrue_diff = treat_data.mean() - control_data.mean()\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.plot(cum_avg_diff, label=\"Cumulative Avg.

This reflects a reduction in uncertainty—with small samples, estimates of the mean difference vary widely due to random noise. As the number of observations grows, the law of large numbers ensures that sample estimates converge toward the true underlying difference, and the variability across simulations shrinks.\nAt all sample sizes, the distributions tend to center slightly below zero, which is consistent with the observed data where treatment donors gave slightly less than control donors, on average. While the difference is small and not statistically significant, the simulation reinforces that larger sample sizes produce more stable and precise estimates, even when the underlying effect is near zero.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\ncontrol_data = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 0) & (df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0)][\"amount\"].values\ntreat_data = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0)][\"amount\"].values\n\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(14, 10))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    diffs = []\n    for _ in range(1000):\n        treat_sample = np.random.choice(treat_data, size=n, replace=True)\n        ctrl_sample = np.random.choice(control_data, size=n, replace=True)\n        diffs.append(treat_sample.mean() - ctrl_sample.mean())\n    \n    ax = axes[i]\n    ax.hist(diffs, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='white')\n    ax.axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)\n    ax.set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Difference in Mean Donation (Treatment - Control)\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n\nplt.suptitle(\"Distribution of Simulated Mean Differences\", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')\nplt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0, 1, 0.96])\nplt.show()"

Most of the sample resides in blue states (59.5%), and the majority of donors are male (70.6%) and not donating as a couple (88.7%).\nThe histograms of numeric variables show that both donation-related and historical giving behaviors are highly skewed to the right. Most donation amounts are under $100, and both highest past donation and frequency of past donations exhibit long right tails, suggesting that a small subset of donors account for a disproportionately large share of past giving. The recency variable (mrm2) also shows many donors who haven’t contributed recently, with the most frequent values clustered between 0 and 12 months.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"../data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# categorical\ncategorical_vars = ['treatment', 'gave', 'red0', 'female', 'couple']\nlabel_map = {\n    'treatment': {0: 'Control', 1: 'Treatment'},\n    'gave': {0: 'Did Not Give', 1: 'Gave'},\n    'red0': {0: 'Blue State', 1: 'Red State'},\n    'female': {0: 'Male', 1: 'Female'},\n    'couple': {0: 'Single', 1: 'Couple'}\n}\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(16, 8))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, var in enumerate(categorical_vars):\n    ax = axes[i]\n    counts = df[var].value_counts().sort_index()\n    labels = list(label_map[var].values())\n    bars = ax.bar(labels, counts.values, color=sns.color_palette(\"pastel\"))\n\n    for bar, count in zip(bars, counts.values):\n        pct = count / df.shape[0]\n        ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, bar.get_height(), f'{pct:.1%}',\n                ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=9)\n\n    ax.set_title(f\"{var.capitalize()} Distribution\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\n\nif len(categorical_vars) &lt;

This supports the internal validity of any subsequent causal analysis."

Specifically, receiving a matching grant offer increases the probability of donating by about 0.42 percentage points—rising from roughly 1.79% in the control group to 2.21% in the treatment group. While this absolute change may appear small, it represents a relative increase of over 20%, which is substantial given the typically low baseline response rate in charitable giving.\nTo further support this finding, I estimate a probit model where the outcome is whether a donation was made and the explanatory variable is treatment assignment. The coefficient on treatment is 0.087, which is also statistically significant at the 1% level. Although the coefficient cannot be interpreted directly as a probability, it indicates an increase in the latent propensity to donate among individuals who received the matching message.\nTaken together, the results provide consistent evidence that even modest psychological framing—such as mentioning that a donation will be matched—can meaningfully increase donor response.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"../data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nfrom statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import Probit\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nX = sm.add_constant(df['treatment'])\nprobit_model = Probit(df['gave'], X).fit()\n\nprint(probit_model.summary())\n\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n                          Probit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

The differences in mean donation rates across these groups are all very small and none are statistically significant at the 5% level. All p-values are well above 0.30. This suggests that the presence of a match itself may be sufficient to motivate behavior, while increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 offers little incremental benefit.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"../data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import t as t_dist\n\ntreatment_df = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1]\n\nratios = {\n    1: treatment_df[treatment_df[\"ratio\"] == 1][\"gave\"],\n    2: treatment_df[treatment_df[\"ratio\"] == 2][\"gave\"],\n    3: treatment_df[treatment_df[\"ratio\"] == 3][\"gave\"]\n}\n\n# t-test\ndef manual_ttest(group1, group2):\n    mean_diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()\n    se = np.sqrt(group1.var(ddof=1)/len(group1) + group2.var(ddof=1)/len(group2))\n    t_stat = mean_diff / se\n    df_denom = (group1.var(ddof=1)/len(group1) + group2.var(ddof=1)/len(group2))**2 / (\n        (group1.var(ddof=1)**2 / ((len(group1)**2)*(len(group1)-1))) + \n        (group2.var(ddof=1)**2 / ((len(group2)**2)*(len(group2)-1)))\n    )\n    p_val = 2 * (1 - t_dist.cdf(abs(t_stat), df=df_denom))\n    return round(mean_diff, 4), round(t_stat, 3), round(p_val, 4)\n\nresults = []\nfor high, low in [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]:\n    diff, t_stat, p_val = manual_ttest(ratios[high], ratios[low])\n    results.append({\n        \"Comparison\": f\"{high}:1 vs {low}:1\",\n        \"Mean Diff\": diff,\n        \"T-stat\": t_stat,\n        \"P-value\": p_val\n    })\n\npd.DataFrame(results)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison\nMean Diff\nT-stat\nP-value\n\n\n\n\n0\n2:1 vs 1:1\n0.0019\n0.965\n0.3345\n\n\n1\n3:1 vs 1:1\n0.0020\n1.015\n0.3101\n\n\n2\n3:1 vs 2:1\n0.0001\n0.050\n0.9600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether higher match ratios influence the likelihood of donating, I regress the binary outcome gave on the categorical variable ratio, using only the treatment group. The 1:1 match ratio serves as the reference category, and the model estimates how donation rates differ under 2:1 and 3:1 matching offers.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"../data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\ntreat_df = df[df[\"ratio\"].isin([1, 2, 3])].copy()\n\ntreat_df[\"ratio\"] = treat_df[\"ratio\"].astype(\"category\")\n\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nmodel = smf.ols(\"gave ~ C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))\", data=treat_df).fit()\n\nparams = model.params\npvals = model.pvalues\n\nprint(\"Linear regression comparing match ratios (baseline: 1:1):\")\nprint(f\"  • Intercept (1:1 match): {params['Intercept']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  • 2:1 vs 1:1 match: Coef = {params['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.2]']:.4f}, p = {pvals['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.2]']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  • 3:1 vs 1:1 match: Coef = {params['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.3]']:.4f}, p = {pvals['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.3]']:.4f}\")\n\n\nLinear regression comparing match ratios (baseline: 1:1):\n  • Intercept (1:1 match): 0.0207\n  • 2:1 vs 1:1 match: Coef = 0.0019, p = 0.3383\n  • 3:1 vs 1:1 match: Coef = 0.0020, p = 0.3133\n\n\nThe estimated coefficients for ratio2 and ratio3 are positive, suggesting slightly higher donation rates compared to the 1:1 baseline. However, both coefficients are not statistically significant (p-values &gt; 0.3), indicating that the observed differences could be due to random variation rather than a true treatment effect.\nTo assess whether increasing the match ratio leads to higher response, I compared donation rates directly from the data and from the regression coefficients.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"../data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nrate_1 = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio\"] == 1)][\"gave\"].mean()\nrate_2 = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio\"] == 2)][\"gave\"].mean()\nrate_3 = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio\"] == 3)][\"gave\"].mean()\n\ndiff_2_vs_1_data = rate_2 - rate_1\ndiff_3_vs_2_data = rate_3 - rate_2\n\ncoef_2 = model.params['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.2]']\ncoef_3 = model.params['C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))[T.3]']\ndiff_3_vs_2_coef = coef_3 - coef_2\n\nprint(\"Donation rate differences (direct from data):\")\nprint(f\"  • 2:1 vs 1:1: {round(diff_2_vs_1_data, 4)}\")\nprint(f\"  • 3:1 vs 2:1: {round(diff_3_vs_2_data, 4)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nEstimated difference from regression coefficients:\")\nprint(f\"  • 2:1 vs 1:1: {round(coef_2, 4)}\")\nprint(f\"  • 3:1 vs 2:1: {round(diff_3_vs_2_coef, 4)}\")\n\n\nDonation rate differences (direct from data):\n  • 2:1 vs 1:1: 0.0019\n  • 3:1 vs 2:1: 0.0001\n\nEstimated difference from regression coefficients:\n  • 2:1 vs 1:1: 0.0019\n  • 3:1 vs 2:1: 0.0001\n\n\nMoving from a 1:1 to a 2:1 match produced a small increase of 0.19%, while the difference between 3:1 and 2:1 was nearly zero (0.01%). These results were mirrored exactly in the regression estimates.\nIn practical terms, offering a match matters, but increasing the match size does not appear to further improve donation response. For fundraisers, this suggests that a basic 1:1 match may be just as effective as higher ratios, but at a lower cost.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\nI regress donation amount on the match ratio using the treatment group, with 1:1 as the reference group. The baseline average donation under 1:1 is $0.94. Compared to this:\n\nThe 2:1 group gives $0.09 more (p = 0.46)\nThe 3:1 group gives almost the same (p = 0.99)\n\nThis suggests that higher match ratios do not meaningfully affect how much people donate, even if they influence whether they donate at all.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"../data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\namount_df = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio\"].isin([1, 2, 3]))].copy()\n\n\namount_df[\"ratio\"] = amount_df[\"ratio\"].astype(\"category\")\namount_df[\"ratio\"] = amount_df[\"ratio\"].cat.remove_unused_categories()\n\nmodel_amount = smf.ols(\"amount ~ C(ratio, Treatment(reference=1))\", data=amount_df).fit()\n\nmodel_amount.summary()\n\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

Initially, the cumulative average fluctuates substantially, reflecting noise in small samples. As the number of simulated pairs increases, the cumulative average steadily converges toward the true mean difference (indicated by the red dashed line).\nThis pattern illustrates the Law of Large Numbers: with enough data, the average of simulated differences approximates the population-level treatment effect. In this case, the cumulative average stabilizes around the true mean difference, providing visual confirmation that our estimate becomes more reliable as sample size increases.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"../data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\ncontrol_data = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 0) & (df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0)][\"amount\"]\ntreat_data = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0)][\"amount\"]\n\n# simulation\ncontrol_draws = np.random.choice(control_data, size=100000, replace=True)\ntreat_draws = np.random.choice(treat_data, size=10000, replace=True)\n\ndiffs = treat_draws - control_draws[:10000]\ncum_avg_diff = np.cumsum(diffs) / np.arange(1, len(diffs) + 1)\ntrue_diff = treat_data.mean() - control_data.mean()\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.plot(cum_avg_diff, label=\"Cumulative Avg.

This reflects a reduction in uncertainty—with small samples, estimates of the mean difference vary widely due to random noise. As the number of observations grows, the law of large numbers ensures that sample estimates converge toward the true underlying difference, and the variability across simulations shrinks.\nAt all sample sizes, the distributions tend to center slightly below zero, which is consistent with the observed data where treatment donors gave slightly less than control donors, on average. While the difference is small and not statistically significant, the simulation reinforces that larger sample sizes produce more stable and precise estimates, even when the underlying effect is near zero.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"../data/karlan_list_2007.dta\")\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\ncontrol_data = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 0) & (df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0)][\"amount\"].values\ntreat_data = df[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0)][\"amount\"].values\n\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(14, 10))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    diffs = []\n    for _ in range(1000):\n        treat_sample = np.random.choice(treat_data, size=n, replace=True)\n        ctrl_sample = np.random.choice(control_data, size=n, replace=True)\n        diffs.append(treat_sample.mean() - ctrl_sample.mean())\n    \n    ax = axes[i]\n    ax.hist(diffs, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='white')\n    ax.axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)\n    ax.set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Difference in Mean Donation (Treatment - Control)\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n\nplt.suptitle(\"Distribution of Simulated Mean Differences\", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')\nplt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0, 1, 0.96])\nplt.show()"
